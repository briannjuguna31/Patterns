Feature of good design
    Code reuse
    - reduce development costs
    - Consistent Behavior 
    
    Exten­si­bil­i­ty
    -- making it more flexible and adaptable to evolving  requirements.
    - Abstraction and Polymorphism
    - Open-Closed Principle

Design Principles
    Encapsulate What Varies
    -- Iden­ti­fy the aspects of your appli­ca­tion that vary and sep­a­rate them from what stays the same
    - Separation of Concerns(minimize effects caused by changes)

    - Encap­su­la­tion on a method level
    - Encap­su­la­tion on a class level

    Program to an Interface, not an Implementation
    -- promotes loose coupling, flexibility, and extensibility in software systems.

    Favor Composition Over Inheritance
